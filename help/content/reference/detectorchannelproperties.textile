|_. Property |_. Description|_. Domain|_. Mandatory|
| __Average__| The (arithmetic) mean is calculated from __Average__ measurements. (if omitted no average is calculated.)| !../../img/math/N.png(natural numbers)!| false|
| __Max. Deviation (%)__| The deviation (%) of __Average__ successive measurements must be less or equal the given value. If that constraint is not fulfilled the first measurement is dropped and a new one is taken until the condition is met. (If omitted the tolerance check always validates.)| [0,100]| false|
| __Minimum__| If the mean of the first __Average__ measurements is less than __Minimum__ a tolerance check is conducted (if omitted no tolerance check is done).| | false|
| __Max.Attempts__| If the tolerance check fails __Max.Attempts__ times the lastly calculated mean is used (and a warning is given). (If omitted __Max.Attempts__ = ==&infin;== is assumed, if __Max.Attempts__ < __Average__ then __Max.Attempts__ = __Average__ is assumed.)| !../../img/math/N.png(natural numbers)!| false|
| __Confirm Trigger manual__| | {true, false}| true|
