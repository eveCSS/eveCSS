It defines which devices will be involved and how they behave.<br/>Within a scan description multiple scans are possible. Each of them is represented by a chain. A chain is a composition of appended and nested scan modules (arranged as a tree) preceded by an Event. The following figure shows a graphical representation of a scan description as it would appear in the editor.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="eveImage" alt="a scan description example" title="a scan description example" border="0" src="../../img/concepts/scandescription.png"/></p><p>This scan description example only has one chain started by S-0 (the Start Event) followed by a scan module &#8222;SM 1&#8221; which has one appended (&#8222;SM 2 appended&#8221;) and one nested (&#8222;SM 3 nested&#8221;) scan module.</p><h2 id="ScanModules">Scan Modules</h2><p>Scan modules are self-contained units which are partitioned into three stages, a prescan phase, a main phase and a postscan phase:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="eveImage" alt="the three phases of a scan module" title="the three phases of a scan module" border="0" src="../../img/concepts/scanmodule.png"/></p><ul><li>Prescan-phase (prior to a scan): values and options of devices will be set (e.g. open beam shutter).</li><li>Main-phase: actually measuring something by controlling devices (e.g. moving motor axis) and reading detector channels.</li><li>Postscan-phase (after measuring): options and devices are eventually set again, or reset (e.g. close beam shutter)</li></ul><h3 id="AppendedScanModule">Appended Scan Module</h3><p>An appended scan module is executed after the preceding module is completed.</p><h3 id="NestedScanModule">Nested Scan Module</h3><p>A nested scan module is processed at each motor position of its parent scan module. If multiple axes are moved the positions of the axis defined as &#8222;main axis&#8221; are used.<br/>Consider that a scan modules prescan and postscan phases are only processed once (not at each iteration of the nested module(s)).</p></body></html>
