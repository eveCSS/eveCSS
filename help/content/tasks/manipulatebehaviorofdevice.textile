h1(eveTopic). Manipulate the Behavior of a Device

In order to change the behavior of a motor axes or detector channel follow these steps:
==<br/>==
# Select the device you want to change (left click) in the appropriate table (motor axes / detector channels table) in the scan module view. ==<br/>== !(eveImage)../../img/tasks/adddevicetoscanmodule-done.png(select the device of interest)!
# Whether you selected a motor axes or detector channel the corresponding view (Motor Axis View or Detector Channel View) will show the current settings of the device. ==<br/>== !(eveImage)../../img/tasks/manipulatebehaviorofdevice-views.png(motor axis and detector channel view)!
# Now you can enter the behavior of the device.

To get more information about the effects of these settings consult "motor axis behavior":../reference/motoraxisbehavior.html and "detector channel behavior":../reference/detectorchannelbehavior.html .
