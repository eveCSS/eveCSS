h1(eveTopic). Add a Scan Module

There are two kinds of scan modules you can add: 1) an appended scan module, 2) a nested scan module. Starting with an "empty scan description":createscandescription.html follow these steps:
==<br/>==
# In the editor right click on the start event S-0 to open the context menu. Click "Add appended Scan Module". ==<br/>== !(eveImage)../../img/tasks/addscanmodule-appended.png(add appended scan module)!==<br/>==(The option "Add nested Scan Module" isn't available here since events don't have nested elements.)
# Once you've created a scan module it is automatically named. If you right click the created scan module you can either add an appended or a nested scan module or both. If you do both the result should look as follows: ==<br/>== !(eveImage)../../img/concepts/scandescription.png(a scan description containing appended and nested scan modules)!

Once you've added one or more scan modules you can start "adding devices":adddevicetoscanmodule.html .
