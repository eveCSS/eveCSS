h1(eveTopic). Create a Device Description

p. To avoid typing XML tags over and over again a device description is not created within XML itself but with the aid of a shell script called __xmlmsi__. __xmlmsi__ is a macro substitution tool to create device definition files for EVE from simple user-created substitution files. __xmlmsi__ is based on __msi__[1] and as __msi__, it is an EPICS extension which needs the appropriate build environment. __xmlmsi__ conducts the following tasks:

==<br/>==

* calls the __msi__ tool
* verifies the result (XML validation with schema)
* checks for duplicate IDs
