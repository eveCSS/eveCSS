h1(eveTopic). Create a Scan Description

p. If you are not familiar with the concept of a scan description consider reading this "topic":../concepts/scandescription.html first.

==<br/>==

To create a new scan description follow these steps:

==<br/>==

# On the open Editor Perspective click __File -> New -> Scan Description__ ==<br/>== !(eveImage)../../img/tasks/createscandescription-filenew.png(click __File -> New -> Scan Description__)!
# In the appearing dialog either use the "Search..." button or enter a file name manually. Please keep in mind that the file extension must be ".scml". ==<br/>== !(eveImage)../../img/tasks/createscandescription-filename.png(enter a file name)!
# After clicking the "Finish" button you see a new tab in the editor with an empty scan description (only the start event S-0 is present). ==<br/>== !(eveImage)../../img/tasks/createscandescription-done.png(a new scan description)!

p. Now you are able to "Add a scan module":addscanmodule.html to your scan description.
