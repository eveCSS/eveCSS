This package contains the Data Model of a Measuring Station. Generally a 
Measuring Station is a list of 
* Motors
* Motor Axis
* Detectors
* Detector Channels
* Devices
* Options
* PlugIns
* Events
* Selections
which are available. The Measuring Station itself is represented by the
correspondent class (implementing the interface @IMeasuringStation@).

Beginning with a general abstract Formulation of a Device (@AbstractDevice@) there 
are two distinct Devices available which inherit from it. 
The model distinguishes between an @AbstractMainPhaseDevice@  and an  @AbstractPrePostscanDevice@. 
@Motor@, @MotorAxis@, @Detector@ and @DetectorChannel@ are Subclasses of  @AbstractMainPaseDevce@. 
The @AbstractPrePostScanDevice@ distinguishes between @Device@ and @Option@.
The idea behind it is as follows:
One Measuring Cycle is partitioned into three stages, a PreScan Phase, a Main Phase and a PostScan Phase.
# Prior to a scan (PreScan Phase) values and options for Devices will be set.
# The Main Phase actually measures something by moving axis and reading detector channels.
# After measuring (PostScan Phase) options and devices are eventually set again (or reset).
