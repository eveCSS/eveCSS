This package contains the data model of a measuring station. Generally a measuring station is an alignment of devices to run experiments. The measuring station itself is represented by @MeasuringStation@ (implementing the interface @IMeasuringStation@). Beginning with an abstract formulation of a device (@AbstractDevice@) there are two distinct devices available which inherit from it. The model distinguishes between an @AbstractMainPhaseDevice@  and an  @AbstractPrePostscanDevice@. 
@Motor@ and  @MotorAxis@ as well as @Detector@ and  @DetectorChannel@ are Subclasses of  @AbstractMainPaseDevice@. Furthermore @AbstractPrePostScanDevice@ distinguishes between @Device@ and @Option@.

Motors are devices where you can read from or write to (e.g. a 'real' motor or a radiator).They contain at least one axis. To learn more about the behavior of a motor ...
