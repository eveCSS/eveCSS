p. *Note:* __Detector Channel, Normalize Channel, Color, Linestyle, Markstyle__ and __Scaletype__ appear twice (once for each y axis).

fn1. *Note:* These settings can also be modified after "creating a scan description":../tasks/createscandescription.html and executing the scan by clicking on the configure button in the plot view of the "EveEngine Perspective":/help/topic/de.ptb.epics.eve.viewer/help/content/concepts/eveengineperspective.html (see image below).
