h1(eveTopic). Detector Channel Properties

h2(eveTopic). Standard Mode Channel

table(eveRefTable).
|_. Property |_. Description|_. Domain|
| __Average__| The (arithmetic) mean is calculated from __Average__ measurements. (if omitted no average is calculated.)| !../../img/math/N.png(natural numbers)![1]|
| __Max. Deviation (%)__| The deviation (%) of the first two measured values must be less or equal the given value. If that constraint is not fulfilled the first measurement is dropped and a new one is taken until the condition is met. Then the __Average__ calculation begins. (If omitted the tolerance check always validates.)| float|
| __Minimum__| If (and only if) the first measured value is ==&ge;== __Minimum__ a tolerance check is conducted, otherwise only one value is measured. (if omitted no tolerance check is done.)| float|
| __Max.Attempts__| If the tolerance check fails __Max.Attempts__ times the lastly calculated mean is used (and a warning is given). (If omitted __Max.Attempts__ = ==&infin;== is assumed, if __Max.Attempts__ < __Average__ then __Max.Attempts__ = __Average__ is assumed.)| !../../img/math/N.png(natural numbers)![1]|
| __Normalize Channel__| The channel is normalized by the given channel| [2]|
| __Deferred Trigger__| Sets whether triggering / reading of this channel starting after channels without deferred trigger are ready.| {true, false}|
| __Send Detector Ready Event__| Sets whether an event is set after reading the channel is ready.| {true, false}|
| __Events__| One or more Redo Events|  |

h2(eveTopic). Interval Mode Channel

table(eveRefTable).
|_. Property |_. Description|_. Domain|
| __Normalize Channel__|The channel is normalized by the given channel.| [2]|
| __Trigger Interval__|The interval/rate measurements are taken.| !../../img/math/N.png(natural numbers)![1]|
| __Stopped By__|The channel which when finished stops the mean calculation.| [3]|

fn1. The domain is {x | x ==&isin;== !../../img/math/N.png(natural numbers)! ==&and;== 0 < x ==&le;== 2.147.483.647 = 2<sup>31</sup> -1} (positive range of an __integer__ with 32 bits).

fn2. All channels available in the scan module except the channel itself and channels which are normalized themselves.

fn3. All standard mode channels available in the scan module.
