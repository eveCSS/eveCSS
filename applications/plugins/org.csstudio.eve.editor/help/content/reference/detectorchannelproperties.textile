h1(eveTopic). Detector Channel Properties

table(eveRefTable).
|_. Property |_. Description|_. Domain|
| __Average__| The (arithmetic) mean is calculated from __Average__ measurements. (if omitted no average is calculated.)| !../../img/math/N.png(natural numbers)![1]|
| __Max. Deviation (%)__| The deviation (%) of the first two measured values must be less or equal the given value. If that constraint is not fulfilled the first measurement is dropped and a new one is taken until the condition is met. Then the __Average__ calculation begins. (If omitted the tolerance check always validates.)| float|
| __Minimum__| If (and only if) the first measured value is ==&ge;== __Minimum__ a tolerance check is conducted, otherwise only one value is measured. (if omitted no tolerance check is done.)| float|
| __Max.Attempts__| If the tolerance check fails __Max.Attempts__ times the lastly calculated mean is used (and a warning is given). (If omitted __Max.Attempts__ = ==&infin;== is assumed, if __Max.Attempts__ < __Average__ then __Max.Attempts__ = __Average__ is assumed.)| !../../img/math/N.png(natural numbers)![1]|
| __Normalize Channel__| The channel the detector channel should be normalized with| [2]|
| __Deferred Trigger__| Sets whether triggering / reading of this channel starting after channels without deferred trigger are ready.| {true, false}|
| __Send Detector Ready Event__| Sets whether an event is set after reading the channel is ready.| {true, false}|
| __Events__| One or more Redo Events|  |

fn1. To be exact the domain is {x | x ==&isin;== !../../img/math/N.png(natural numbers)! ==&and;== 0 < x ==&le;== 2.147.483.647 = 2<sup>31</sup> -1} (positive range of an __integer__ with 32 bits).

fn2. All detector channels available in the scan module except the channel itself and channels which are normalized themselves.
