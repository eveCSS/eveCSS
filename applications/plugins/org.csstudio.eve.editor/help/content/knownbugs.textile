h3(eveKnownBug). (#2408) Number of scan points (motor positions) limited to 2.147.483.648.

p. Due to the limitation of a (signed) integer scans should not use more than 2<sup>31</sup>-1 scan points. The resulting number shown is number of scan points mod 2<sup>31</sup>-1. 

h3(eveKnownBug). (#1288) The Editor state is dirty but File -> Save is disabled.

p. Sometimes although a scan description in the editor is unsaved the File -> Save menu entries are not enabled. In order to save such a file you can either move a scan module a bit or click on another view. Either will trigger a re-evaluation of the menu entries.

h3(eveKnownBug). (#2963) Engine View not working after scan send to engine if Engine Perspective never was active

p. The Engine View will not work (until restart) if a scan is send via the editor main toolbar button under the following circumstances:

<ul class="eveUL">
 <li>the Engine Perspective wasn't active since the application is running (i.e. it was never loaded)</li>
 <li>an Engine process was already running</li>
 <li>the scan was send without changing perspective</li>
</ul>
