h3(eveKnownBug). (#1288) The Editor state is dirty but File -> Save is disabled.

p. Sometimes although a scan description in the editor is unsaved the File -> Save menu entries are not enabled. In order to save such a file you can either move a scan module a bit or click on another view. Either will trigger a re-evaluation of the menu entries.
