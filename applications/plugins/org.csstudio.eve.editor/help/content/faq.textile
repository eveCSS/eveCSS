h1(eveTopic). Frequently Asked Questions

h3(eveFAQquestion). The Editor state is dirty but File -> Save is disabled.

p. Sometimes although a scan description in the editor is unsaved the File -> Save menu entries are not enabled. In order to save such a file you can either move a scan module a bit or click on another view. Either will trigger a re-evaluation of the menu entries.

h3(eveFAQquestion). Why does the context menu contain a menu named "input methods" ?

p. !(eveImage)../img/faq-inputmethods.png(input methods)!

p. This menu entry is contributed by "Gtk":http://www.gtk.org/. To deactivate it the file @/home/<username>/.gtkrc-2.0@ must contain the following lines:

@gtk-show-input-method-menu = 0@
@gtk-show-unicode-menu = 0@

p. In order to use these settings the application has to be restarted. Keep in mind that this is a global setting, i.e. every application using Gtk will not show this menu anymore.
