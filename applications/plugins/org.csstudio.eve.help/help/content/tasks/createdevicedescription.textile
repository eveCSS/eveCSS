h1(eveTopic). Create a Device Description

p. To avoid typing XML tags over and over again a device description is not created within XML itself but with the aid of a shell script called @eveBuild@. @eveBuild@ uses a macro substitution tool to create device definition files for EVE from simple user-created substitution files. 

p. To create a device description (XML) from your substitution file (xsubst) named 'mydevices.xsubst' just type 

p(code). @eveBuild mydevices.xsubst@

p. By omitting the file argument the default file is taken. In this case the directory the command is called from has to be the main directory of your test site, e.g. @/messung/test@. The name of the default file then would be @test.xsubst@. In detail, the script does

* translate the given xsubst into XML
* replaces occurences of '/' characters in id tags with '%' (EPICS PV name restrictions)
* validates the resulting XML file with the current XML schema
* searches for duplicate id tags

p. More information on the syntax of substitution files is given "here":/help/topic/de.ptb.epics.eve.help/help/content/reference/xmlmsisyntax.html.
