* [Feature-#5742] Scanmodule and chain pause events are no longer available. Old scans containing those are transformed into newly introduced pause conditions a.k.a. "inhibit state":concepts/inhibitstate.html. The pause event tab in the "SM Events View":concepts/smeventsview.html has been removed. Pause conditions can be added, removed and edited in the "Chain View":concepts/chainview.html:

p(((. When loading scml files of prior versions, events are transformed as follows: Scanmodule pause events and chain pause events are transformed into chain pause conditions. Hysteresis definitions are detected and combined (using the new continue limit). Duplicates are eliminated. 

* [Bug Fix-#5935] fixed several broken links for help topics.
