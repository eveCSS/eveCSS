h1(eveTopic|#top). Edit Properties of a Pre-/Postscan

{toc:style=circle|maxLevel=3}

p. Several properties of a Pre-/Postscan added to a scan module can be modified within the Pre-/Postscan table of the SM Prescan / Postscan / Positioning / Plot View. Editing the different attributes is explained in detail below.

h2(eveTopic). Add new entry

p(backToTop). "back to top":#top

p. A new entry can be added with the context menu (right-click). After selecting Prescan or Postscan a device or option can be selected:

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/tasks/editprepostproperties/prepostscan-add.png!

p. If an entry of a certain device or option already exists, but no Postscan is set (shown as "-"), a Postscan can be added by clicking in the column:

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/tasks/editprepostproperties/prepostscan-createA.png!

p. After clicking into the column a Postscan with a default value is created (which can be "edited":#edit later):

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/tasks/editprepostproperties/prepostscan-createB.png!

p. Options or devices with discrete values get one of their discrete values as default:

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/tasks/editprepostproperties/prepostscan-creatediscreteB.png!

p. Adding a Prescan works the same way. Existing entries can be "deleted":#delete later.

h2(eveTopic|#edit). Edit existing entry

p(backToTop). "back to top":#top

p. An existing value of a Prescan or Postscan can be edited by clicking in the corresponding column. The edited text is applied with __enter__ or discarded with __escape__:

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/tasks/editprepostproperties/prepostscan-edit.png!

p. If the device or option to be edited is discrete a combo box is opened instead:

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/tasks/editprepostproperties/prepostscan-editdiscrete.png!

p. Postscans have an additional (boolean) attribute __reset original__. The state is toggled between __true__ and __false__ by clicking on the value:

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/tasks/editprepostproperties/prepostscan-resetA.png!

h2(eveTopic|#delete). Remove entry

p(backToTop). "back to top":#top

p. An existing Prescan or Postscan can be removed by clicking in the column (for editing), removing the text and applying with __enter__:

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/tasks/editprepostproperties/prepostscan-delete.png!

p. For discrete values the additional entry "-" in the combo box has to be selected to remove the Prescan or Postscan:

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/tasks/editprepostproperties/prepostscan-deletediscrete.png!

p. If after removing a Pre- or Postscan neither exists, the entry is removed completely:

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/tasks/editprepostproperties/prepostscan-deleteall.png!

p. A complete entry (with Prescan, Postscan or both) can also be removed via context menu:

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/tasks/editprepostproperties/prepostscan-remove.png!
