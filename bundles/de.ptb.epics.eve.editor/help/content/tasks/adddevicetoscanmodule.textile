p. To add an axis or channel to the selected scan module select the SM Axes / Channels View and (right-)click in the white area of the corresponding table to open a context menu showing all devices (ordered by classes). Navigate to the axis you want to add and click on it (or click on add all to add all devices of the class). Note that depending on the current device definition and configuration (class names) "different devices are shown":../reference/deviceclasses.html.
