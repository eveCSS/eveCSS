h1(eveTopic). Import Axes from CSV

p. Motor Axes (positions) can be imported from a CSV file. The CSV file must be formatted as follows:

* The first line must contain the axes names separated by the delimiter
* The following lines contain values separated by the delimiter
* Axes are allowed to have a different amount of positions

p. An example content of a file:
<pre><code>PP_Motor1;PP_Motor2;PP_Motor3;PP_Motor4;Filter_1;Filter_2
0;0;0;2.3;A;B
1;2;5;2.4;A;B
2;4;10;2.5;A;B
3;6;15;2.4;A;B
4;8;20;2.3;A;B
5;10;25;2.2;A;B
</code></pre>

p. The default delimiter is a 'semicolon'. It can be configured in the Preferences:

!(eveImage)../../img/tasks/importcsv-preferences.png(CSV Import Preferences Dialog)!

p. The two check boxes define whether warnings and/or errors should be reported. If there were both warnings and errors during the CSV import then a dialog like the following will be shown:

!(eveImage)../../img/tasks/importcsv-warningerror.png(CSV Import Warnings and Errors)!

p. Enabling only one type of reporting in the preferences eventually shows only that kind of messages. If neither warnings nor errors are enabled no dialog is shown at all (even if warnings or errors were generated by the import).

p. As described in the image above:

* an Axis not found in the current device definition will not be imported
* an Axis already present in the current scan module will be overwritten

Keep in mind that when disabling warning and error messages this will be done without warning.
