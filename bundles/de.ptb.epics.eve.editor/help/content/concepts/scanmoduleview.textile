h1(eveTopic|#top). Scan Module View

{toc:style=circle|maxLevel=2}

The content of the ScanModuleView depends on the type of the currently selected scan module. It shows attributes that can be altered and allows adding/deleting devices, actions, events, etc. in certain cases. The different appearances are shown in the following.

h2(eveTopic). Scan Module

p(backToTop). "back to top":#top

p. For a common (a.k.a. classic) scan module the Scan Module View looks as follows:

h3(eveTopic). Actions

* __Prescan__: Allows defining actions executed before the main phase.
* __Postscan__: Allows defining actions executed after the main phase.
* __Positioning__: Allows moving axes to calculated positions after the main phase.
* __Plot__: Allows defining plot windows for live plots during scan execution. Properties of selected plots can be viewed or modified in the "Plot Window View":plotwindowview.html.

h3(eveTopic). Events

p. A scan module allows defining different types of events to pause execution, redo the last measurement, etc. More information about events is found "here":events.html.

h2(eveTopic). Static Axis Snapshot

p(backToTop). "back to top":#top

p. When a scan module of type "Axis Snapshot (static)" is selected, the view shows a table containing all axes contained in the snapshot. Axes can be added or removed.

h2(eveTopic). Static Channel Snapshot

p(backToTop). "back to top":#top

p. When a scan module of type "Channel Snapshot (static)" is selected the view shows a table containing all channels contained in the snapshot. Channels can be added or removed.

h2(eveTopic). Dynamic Axis Snapshot

p(backToTop). "back to top":#top

p. Scan modules of type "Axis Snapshot (dynamic)" cannot be altered. Their contents is determined during scan execution. The view shows an immutable table showing all axes contained in the snapshot based on the currently loaded device definition.
