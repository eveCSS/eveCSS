h1(eveTopic). Chain View

p. The Chain View contains properties concerning a chain. The Chain shown is the one selected. A chain is also "selected" if its start event or one of its scan modules is selected.

p. For each chain events could be defined which influence execution of the scan (by pausing it, redoing it, etc.).
