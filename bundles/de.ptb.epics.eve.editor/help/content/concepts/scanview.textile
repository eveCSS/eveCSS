p. The properties are described in detail below.

h2(eveTopic). Comment

p. A descriptive text can be saved in the comment. It appears as an attribute in the data file. Macro replacement is available. To see which macros are available see the tooltip text.

h2(eveTopic). Filename

p. The filename is the location where the data should be saved to. The folder can either be set manually or selected via file dialog (Browse button). Macro replacement is available. To see which macros are available see the tooltip text. A preview of the result is shown below the text field.

h2(eveTopic). Repeat Count

p. The __Repeat Count__ sets how often the scan should be executed +in addition to the first execution+. For Example a __Repeat Count__ of 1 would execute the scan one additional time after the first run. Possible values are integers in @[0, 1, ..., 999999]@.

h2(eveTopic). Save SCML

p. __Save Scan-Description__ defines whether the scan description should be saved along with the data. The H5 file with embedded SCML can be opened by the editor and viewer like a SCML file. To extract the data file manually see "here":/help/topic/de.ptb.epics.eve.help/help/content/tasks/h5unpack.html.

h2(eveTopic). Confirm Save

p. __Confirm Save__ defines whether the user has to confirm that the data should be saved after execution. If "no" is selected no data is saved!

h2(eveTopic). Append Autoincrementing Number

p. __Append Autoincrementing Number__ indicates whether a five digit number should be appened to the filename (before the suffix). The chosen number is the largest number found (@filename<number>.h5@) plus 1.

h2(eveTopic). Monitored Devices

p. Alongside the devices which are used in a scan additional devices of interest could be monitored (its inital value as well as each change is written to the data file). The Scan View offers four types of monitoring:

* **none**: no additional devices are monitored
* **used in scan**: all options of devices used in the scan marked with @monitor=true@ in the device definition are monitored
* **as in device defition**: all options of devices in the device definition marked with @monitor=true@ are monitored
* **custom**: options manually selected are monitored

When clicking the Edit button a dialog opens where options can be selected for monitoring:

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/concepts/ScanView/monitordialog.png(dialog for selecting options for monitoring.Table contents depends on selection of the tree)!

p. The Dialog contains two parts. On the left there is a tree containing the devices of the device definition ordered by class. The contents of the table on the right depends on the selection in the tree. Multiple selections are possible (using shift click).
