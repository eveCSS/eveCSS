h1(eveTopic). Scan Description

p. A scan description is a complete description of a measurement process. It defines which devices will be involved and how they behave.
Within a scan description multiple scans are possible. Each of them is represented by a chain. A chain is a composition of appended and nested scan modules (arranged as a tree) preceded by an event. The following figure shows a graphical representation of a scan description with one chain as it would appear in the editor:

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/concepts/ScanDescription/scandescription.png(a scan description example)!

p. This scan description example only has one chain started by S-0-0-E (the Start Event) followed by a scan module "SM 1" which has one appended ("SM 2") and one nested ("SM 3") scan module.

p. An __appended__ scan module is executed after the preceding module is completed. A __nested__ scan module is processed at each motor position of its parent scan module.

p. For now exactly one chain can be created with EVE Editor. The Start Event S-0-0-E is automatically triggered when the Scan is being started. In the future multiple chains with different start events (e.g. the completion of another scan module, chain, etc.) may be possible.

h2. Scan Modules

p. A scan module is a unit of abstraction to structure a scan. There are five different types of scan modules. Each of them has a different appearance in the "Editor":editor.html.

h3. ScanModule

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/concepts/ScanDescription/ScanModuleTypes-Classic.png(Empty Scan Module)!

p. A simple scan module is partitioned into multiple stages called pre-scan, main, post-scan and positioning:

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/concepts/ScanDescription/ClassicScanModule.png(the phases of a common scan module)!

Execution of the scan module is as follows:

* the motors are moved to their start position (first given/calculated value)
* Pre-scan: values and options of devices are set (e.g. open beam shutter, set motor velocity)
* Main: The main phase is executed n times where n is the (maximum) number of given motor positions
** wait for 'settle time' seconds (only after first motor position)
** wait for 'trigger delay' seconds
** trigger detectors
** the nested scan module (if any) is executed
** trigger detectors declared as deferred
** move motors to next position (if any)
* Post-scan: options and devices are set, or reset to their original value
* Positioning: one or more axes from the main-phase can be moved to a calculated position (e.g. move a motor to the center of the measured values of a detector used in the main phase)

p. __Note__ that the settle time delay is only executed for the first motor position.

p. __Note__ that prescan actions are executed +after+ the first motor position is actuated.

P. Die __Prescan__ Aktionen werden ausgeführt, nachdem die erste Position des Scan Modules angefahren wurde. Ob die Prescan-Aktion auf eine Antwort wartet oder nur einfach abgeschickt wird, hängt von ihrer Vereinbarung im xml File ab (method="GETPUTCB" oder ="GETPUT")

P. Ob die Postscan-Aktion auf eine Antwort wartet oder nur einfach abgeschickt wird, hängt von ihrer Vereinbarung im xml File ab (method="GETPUTCB" oder ="GETPUT")

p. __Note__ that a scan modules pre-scan, post-scan and positioning phases are only processed once (not at each iteration of its nested module(s)).

p. __Note__ that axes in the parent and nested scan modules are actuated one after another (to reach their starting positions).

h3. Axis Snapshot (Static)

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/concepts/ScanDescription/ScanModuleTypes-StaticAxisPositions.png(Static Axis Snapshot)!

p. A static axis snapshot module defines a list of motor axes which records the current position of these axes. The list is modifiable.

h3. Channel Snapshot (Static)

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/concepts/ScanDescription/ScanModuleTypes-StaticChannelValues.png(Static Channel Snapshot)!

p. A static channel snapshot module defines a list of detector channels which are read once. The list is modifiable.

h3. Axis Snapshot (Dynamic)

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/concepts/ScanDescription/ScanModuleTypes-DynamicAxisPositions.png(Dynamic Axis Snapshot)!

p. A dynamic axis snapshot module records the current position of all axes found in the given device definition at the time of execution of the scan. The Editor shows a preview of all axes which would be considered if the scan would be executed right now.

h3. Channel Snapshot (Dynamic)

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/concepts/ScanDescription/ScanModuleTypes-DynamicChannelValues.png(Dynamic Channel Snapshot)!

p. A dynamic channel snapshot module reads the value of all detector channels found in the given device definition at the time of execution of the scan. The Editor shows a preview of all channels which would be considered if the scan would be executed right now.
