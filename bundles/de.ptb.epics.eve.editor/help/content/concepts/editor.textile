h1(eveTopic|#top). Scan Description Editor

{toc:style=circle|maxLevel=3}

p. The Scan Description Editor shows the graphical representation of a scan. Each chain of s scan is represented by a start event and scan modules connected by arrows. Below is an example of a scan description editor showing a scan with a chain containing three scan modules:

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/concepts/ScanDescriptionEditor/ScanDescriptionEditor-SCML.png(Scan Description Editor-Graphical Representation as a tree of Chains and Scanmodules)!

p. Appended scan modules always have their origin on the right edge of a scan module. Arrows to nested scan modules always start from the bottom. More information about scan modules is found "here":scandescription.html.

p. Multiple scan descriptions can be open simultaneously. They are arranged in tabs.

h2(eveTopic). Palette and Tools

p(backToTop). "back to top":#top

p. On the right a palette with different tools is shown (it must be expanded on the very first start of the application). Depending on the active tool different interactions with the graphical objects are possible.

h3(eveTopic). Selection Tool

p. Most of the Views in the EveEditor Perspective are context sensitive, i.e. depending on the current selection different content is shown. In the Scan Description Editor scan modules can be selected with the Selection Tool. The selection is represented by a frame border and a color change. The "ScanModuleView":scanmoduleview.html then shows the properties of this selected module. 

p. With a "shift click" scan modules could be added to the selection. When multiple scan modules are selected one of them is the __primary selection__ (used for context sensitive views).

p. The selection tool is also used to move scan modules. When holding the left mouse button the selected modules can be moved by dragging.

p. Connections can also be moved to other anchor points of scan modules by dragging them.

h3(eveTopic). Marquee Tool

p. With the Marquee tool a rectangle is created selecting everything inside of it. Afterwards the selection tool is enabled automatically.

h3(eveTopic). Connection Tool

p. With the Connection tool connections between scan modules (which do not already have appended, nested or parent connections) can be created. When hovering scan modules possible connection points are highlighted. The first click creates the starting point of a connection, the second click finished it.

h3(eveTopic). Create Tools

p. Create tools create scan modules of different types. The type of a scan module can also be changed (later) with the help of the "Change To" context menu:
