h1(eveTopic). Pause Conditions (Inhibit-State)

p. Each chain can have zero or more pause conditions. A pause condition is a definition based on a device, an operator and a limit evaluating to __true__ or __false__, e.g. a value of a device is equal to a given constant. All pause conditions in a chain define an __inhibit-state__, i.e. if any of the definitions evaluates to __true__, execution is inhibited (the chain is paused) until +all+ definitions evaluate to __false__.

h2(eveTopic). Manual Override

p. Any client connected to an engine executing a scan which currently is paused due to an inhibit state evaluated to __true__, can override that state by pressing the __Play__-Button. Any pause condition which evaluated to __true__ is now in an __overridden__ state as long as it becomes __false__ again. If there are only false and overridden pause conditions the chain resumes execution.

h2(eveTopic). Pause Button (User-Pause)

p. Keep in mind, that by pressing the pause button, the whole scan is paused, i.e. each chain is paused. The user pause overrules any inhibit states. A scan paused by the user can only be resumed by pressing the __Play__-Button (even is all pause conditions suddenly evaluate to __false__).

h2(eveTopic). Hysteresis

p. For any pause condition a hysteresis can be defined, i.e. besides the pause limit which alongside the operator defines when the condition evaluates to __true__ (induce pause state) a second value, the __continue limit__ can be set to enforce the expression to evaluate to __false__ regarding that value. 

h3(eveTopic). Example

p. Consider the following definition of a device value with operator lt (less than), pause limit and (different) continue limit:

p=. !(eveImage)../../img/concepts/InhibitState/hysteresis-example.png(Hysteresis example device with operator lt, pause limit 5 and continue limit 100)!

p. The chain will pause any time the given value is less than five. But (in contrast to the situation where no continue limit is set) it will resume only when the value is greater or equal to 100 (and not five).
