They just simulate a certain behavior. In eveCSS there are different types of virtual devices which are described in the following. A summary is given by the <a href="/help/topic/de.ptb.epics.eve.help/help/content/reference/virtualdevices.html">Virtual Devices Reference Page</a>.</p><h2 id="VirtualMotorAxes" class="eveTopic">Virtual Motor Axes</h2><p class="backToTop"><a href="#top">back to top</a></p><p>Instead of positions given by a translational/rotational movement by a physical device (or a heating/cooling process with temperatures) a virtual motor axis just emulates these positions with (calculated) values. Besides that there is no movement command send (and the delay until the axis has finished moving) there is no difference to a physical axis if used in a scan.</p><h3 id="Counter" class="eveTopic">Counter</h3><p>A Counter&#8217;s behavior depends on the chosen <code>stepfunction</code>. An Add/Multiply Counter starts with the Start value, calculates the next values based upon the given <code>stepcount</code> / <code>stepfunction</code> and finishes with the stop value. The value is propagated the time it is calculated.</p><p>It is also possible to use a counter in <code>file</code> / <code>positionlist</code> or <code>range</code> mode. Then the sequence of values are just the given values. Hence no values are calculated the (arrival) response will be almost immediate.</p><h3 id="secTimer" class="eveTopic">(sec) Timer</h3><p>When using the Timer virtual device given values are interpreted as seconds elapsed since a certain reference point. The reference point varies depending on the chosen position mode.</p><p>In <i>absolute</i> position mode the values are the seconds elapsed since the start of the scan module, e.g. a <i>start</i> value of 2 means that two seconds after the start of the scan module the first measurement is made. The reported value is also 2.</p><p>In <i>relative</i> position mode the values are still the seconds elapsed since the start of the scan module but the reported value will be different since the start of the scan module is the time elapsed since the start of the scan (instead of zero). So a <i>start</i> value of 2 for example still means that two seconds after the start of the scan module the first measurement is made but the reported value depends on when the scan module is executed.</p><h4 id="Example1nestedabsolutetimer" class="eveTopic">Example 1 &#8211; nested absolute timer</h4><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="eveImage" alt="a counter scan module with a nested timer scan module" title="a counter scan module with a nested timer scan module" border="0" src="../../img/concepts/virtualdevices/countertimer.png"/></p><p>Given: A Scan Module with a Counter (1 to 3), a nested scan module with<br/>Timer <i>Start</i>=3, <i>Stop</i>=7, <i>Stepwidth</i>=1 (absolute) &rArr; <i>Stepcount</i>=4 (calculated)</p><p>Motor positions: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7</p><p>Since the values are interpreted as absolute since the start of the scan module each iteration reports the same sequence of numbers.</p><h4 id="Example2nestedrelativetimer" class="eveTopic">Example 2 &#8211; nested relative timer</h4><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="eveImage" alt="a counter scan module with a nested timer scan module" title="a counter scan module with a nested timer scan module" border="0" src="../../img/concepts/virtualdevices/countertimer.png"/></p><p>Given: A Scan Module with a Counter (1 to 3), a nested scan module with<br/>Timer <i>Start</i>=3, <i>Stop</i>=7, <i>Stepwidth</i>=1 (relative) &rArr; <i>Stepcount</i>=4 (calculated)</p><p>Motor positions: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21</p><p>The defined values are interpreted as relative to the time elapsed since the start of the scan until the start of the scan module, i.e. the second iteration of the scan module start immediately after the first iteration is done (at 7 seconds).

They can be used for instance to add &#8222;markers&#8221; to the data file, e.g. timestamps or the current scan module.</p><h3 id="SMCounter" class="eveTopic">SM-Counter</h3><p>SM-Counter counts the number of scan modules executed. A return value of <code>i</code> means that <code>i-1</code> scan modules were already executed and the <code>i</code>-th one is currently executed. Keep in mind that each execution is counted, i.e. a nested scan module is counted each time it is executed.</p><p>There are rumours that certain UI tools use this information to divide a scan into subplots.</p><h4 id="Example1" class="eveTopic">Example 1</h4><p>Imagine the following scan with two appended scan modules. The first contains a counter from one to three, the second a counter from one to two and both containing the sm counter detector:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="eveImage" alt="two appended scan modules, the first with points 1,2,3 and the second with 1,2" title="two appended scan modules, the first with points 1,2,3 and the second with 1,2" border="0" src="../../img/concepts/virtualdevices/smcounter.png"/></p><p>The reported values for the sm counter would be: 1, 1, 1, 2, 2. When the first scan module is executed it is counted (sm counter equals 1). As long as it is executing (three measurements) the counter remains 1. When the second scan module starts sm counter is incremented and reported for each measurement (two times).</p><h4 id="Example2" class="eveTopic">Example 2</h4><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="eveImage" alt="alt" title="alt" border="0" src="../../img/concepts/virtualdevices/smcounter-nested.png"/></p><h3 id="secTimer2" class="eveTopic">(sec) Timer</h3><p>The Timer returns the number of seconds (in double precision) elapsed since the start of the scan.</p><h3 id="msecTimer" class="eveTopic">msec Timer</h3><p>The msec Timer&#8217;s behavior is analog to the (sec) Timer. The only difference is that its unit is milliseconds and its data type is integer. </p><h3 id="dateTimer2" class="eveTopic">date Timer</h3><p>The date Timer channel returns a string containing a timestamp specified in ISO 8601. Its format is <code>YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD</code> (e.g. <code>2017-10-16T15:53:10.050+02:00</code>).
