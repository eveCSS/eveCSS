h1(eveTopic|#top). Extract embedded Scan Description

p. Since version 1.28 the "chain option":/help/topic/de.ptb.epics.eve.editor/help/content/concepts/chain.html "Save Scan Description" embeds the SCML data in the HDF5 data file. The editor and viewer (add to playlist) are capable of loading these files directly. To manually view the file it has to be extracted.

h2(eveTopic). Extract SCML

p. To extract SCML data from a HDF5 data file the following tool can be used:

p(code). @h5unpackscml <h5-file> [<scml-file>]@

p. This will extract embedded SCML data (if any) from the given h5 file to the given scml-file or to a file with similar ending but different suffix if none is given.

p. Example 1: @h5unpackscml /tmp/data.h5@ extracts embedded SCML to @/tmp/data.scml@.

p. Example 2: @h5unpackscml /tmp/data.h5 /tmp/scan.scml@ extracts embedded SCML to @/tmp/scan.scml@.

h2(eveTopic). Embed SCML

p. SCML can also be added to a HDF5 file (if it does not already contain another). To add SCML data to a HDF5 data file the following tool can be used:

p(code). @h5packscml <h5-file> [<scml-file>]@

p. This will embed the given SCML data to the given h5 file. If no scml file is given a SCML file with same prefix name is used.

p. Example 1: @h5packscml data.h5 scan.scml@ embeds the SCML data in @scan.scml@ into @data.h5@.

p. Example 2: @h5packscml data.h5@ embeds SCML data in @data.scml@ into @data.h5@.
