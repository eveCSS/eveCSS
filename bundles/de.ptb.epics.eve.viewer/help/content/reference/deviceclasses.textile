h1(eveTopic). Device Classes (and their influence)

p. Each device (motor, motor axis, detector, detector channel and pre-/postscan device) could be assigned a class name. Depending on that class is the location in the tree hierarchy of the (Local) Devices View the device appears in. The following table shows where to expect a device with a certain class name:

table(eveRefTable).
|_. Device |_. Class Name |_. Location |
|/2. Motor | C | child of root element "C" |
| ==&#8212;== | child of root element "Motors & Axes" |
|/2. Motor Axis | C | child of root element "C" |
| ==&#8212;== | child of its parent (Motor) |
|/2. Detector | C | child of root element "C" |
| ==&#8212;== | child of root element "Detectors & Channels" |
|/2. Detector Channel | C | child of root element "C" |
| ==&#8212;== | child of its parent (Detector) |
|/2. (Pre-/Postscan) Device | C | child of root element "C" |
| ==&#8212;== | child of root element "Devices" |
