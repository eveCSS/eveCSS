|_. Stop | stops the scan after finishing the current scan point. while pending positionings are ignored, post scan actions of the current scan module (and the parents if nested) are still executed. |
|_. Skip | finishes the current scan point, skips the remaining scan points of the current scan module, executes post scan actions and continues with the next scan module (if any) |
|_. Halt | Stops the scan and immediately stops all motor axes. |
