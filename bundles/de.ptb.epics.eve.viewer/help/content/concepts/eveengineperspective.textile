h1(eveTopic). EveEngine Perspective

p. The "Playlist View":playlistview.html (1) shows scans added to the engine which are queued for execution. Scans waiting in the playlist are executed according to the FIFO (first in first out) principle. The currently executing scan is show in the "Engine View":engineview.html (2) which also contains elements to manipulate the execution. For scans containing plot definitions one or more "Plot Views" are shown (4).

p. Additionally to the execution elements the EveEngine perspective contains the same set of views which are found in the "EveDevice Perspective":evedeviceperspective.html with one difference: the devices available in the Devices View are only those participating in the currently executing scan.

p. __Keep in mind__ that once a device is added to the device inspector it remains there even if the scan it belonged to is no longer executing.
