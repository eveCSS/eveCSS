h1(eveTopic). Messages View

p. All messages generated from parts in the EveDevice and EveEngine perspectives (including messages send from the Engine) are shown in the Messages view:

!(eveImage)../../img/concepts/messagesview.png(Messages View)!

p. Additionally to the date and content the message has a source and severity. The severity levels in ascending order are:

p(textCenter). !../../../icons/debug_exc.gif(debug icon)! debug &lt; !../../../icons/information.gif(info icon)! info &lt; !../../../icons/warning_obj.gif(warning icon)! warning (minor) &lt; !../../../icons/error.gif(error icon)! error &lt; !../../../icons/fatalerror_obj.gif(fatal icon)! fatal

p. The toolbar commands allow to clear the list of messages, save them in a text file and adjust filter settings. The filter settings define whether messages of a certain source (i.e. Viewer or Engine) are shown and a threshold (messages with a severity lower than the threshold level are not shown). The following setting defines that only messages of level "warning" and above from each Viewer and Engine should be shown:

p. __Note__ that although a message is not shown, it is present in the Messages view memory. If later on the filter settings are changed they eventually become visible.

p. __Note__ that messages of type !../../../icons/build_exec.gif(system icon)! system are not affected by the filter (they have no severity).
